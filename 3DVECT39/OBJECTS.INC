; Shape data can be almost as large as you need it 'till it crashes. Try a cube
; 20000_x20000_x20000.    Calculations  use  32  bit  registers  and  can  handle
; up to 16 bit locations.  Keeping the object size small will  allow  a  larger
; visible space.  But larger objects will allow you to get  closer  with   more
; accuracy in the mathematics of rotations.  Remember, if you make a really big
; object, set minz to the largest object on the screen so the large object wont
; mess up when you get really close to it.  I have generally found that  larger
; objects "look" better as they have great mathematical resolution.

;
; List of texture bits to date: (options grouped by function:)
;
; Note: "visible" = "points appear counter-clockwise"
;
; Texture definitions:
;
;   0       - normal surface, no features, constant colour.
;   wavey   - steel texture for surface 0 = none,  colour  offset  determines
;             screen offset for texture.  eg 16+7 will use colour block 16-31
;             but make the sine wave texture 14 (7*2) lines down. this is  so
;             all sine wave textures do not appear on the same line.  Windows
;             and engines look good with this feature.  This  option  can  be
;             combined with shading  if  you  want  to  mis-align  sine  wave
;             patterns.
;   shade   - _lambert shading bit, must have normal calculated or  at  least
;             have    free    space     for    _pre_cal_lambert    to    use:
;             eg x,x,x,x,x,1,2,3,1,?,?,?<- these 3 words are surface normal!
;   inverse - inversion bit for shading option.  0=normal shading, 1=inverse
;             inversion automatically occures when other side is displayed.
;   glow    - =shade+inverse
;   last    - colour has same colour as previous surface (used when
;             you want gourad shading, but want to avoid  duplicate
;             calculations - don't set gourad bit if this  is  what
;             you use it for.) when this is used, the colour number
;             determines the new colour block to use.  the  shading
;             of this colour will be the same as the surface before
;             it, but the colour block can be different.
;   mesh    - see the line below? that sort if dot on/dot off thing? thats a
;             mesh texture.  can be combined with shading.
;   glenz   - glenz vector (you know, the stained glass type of  thingy)
;             The colour of surface refers to a cross referanced palette
;             from which the glenz polygon will derive it's new colours.
;             Put the cross referancing palette  offset  into  _xreftable
;             and make the colour index the palette in the table.  Glenz
;             vectors can be used with the shading  option  to  get  the
;             same type of effect as in  Second  Unreal.   Shaded  Glenz
;             Vectors are made by simply having multiple cross referance
;             palettes and setting the surface to  "shade".   This  will
;             select the appropriate table based on surface normal. This
;             option can be combined with shading.
;   stone   - this texture is like the stone texture I saw  in Alone In The
;             Dark.   The   stone   texture   offset    is    loaded   from
;             [_stonetbl+colour*4].  Use the Qbasic  program   stone.bas  to
;             generate more stone textures with different colours or ranges
;             This option can be combined with shading.

; Commands:
;
;   point   - defines a single point; must be repeated! eg dw 64,col,3,3
;   line    - if used, defines a line (must be set to define a true line)
;   himap   - if set, defines a _bitmap,eg: point #, _bitmap #, x scale,y scale
;   lomap   - uses 1/4 scaled _bitmap (every 4'th pixel is sampled), fast
;
;   iterate - generate iteration if side visible (iteration = sub-object)
;   matrix  - modify matrix when generating iteration.  matrix object
;             offset is 3rd word (6'th byte) in future use words.
;
;   both    - side is always visible no matter angle, skips counter-clowise test
;           - "both sides have same texture"
;   double  - side is always visible but other side has other colour
;             "double sided surface"
;             note: if this is used, option "both" must not be used!!
;   onscr   - test if side is on screen - don't use if all points are
;             outside clipping parameters.
;   check   - dont plot this side, just use as test points for visibility.
;             this is mostly used with iterations.
;   gosub   - push current offset and go to another location (offset location - offset $)
;   return  - just like a qbasic return
;   goto    - like qbasic - go to another offset (offset location - offset $)
;   push_matrix        - push rotation matrix
;   pop_matrix         - pop rotation matrix
;   push_location      - push 3d centriodal location
;   pop_location       - pop 3d centroidal location
;   sub_object         - sub_object = matrix+check+iteration+both,?,?,?,?,0,0
;   static_sub_object  - non-rotatable sub_object = check+iteration+both,?,?,?,?,0,0

;
; There are two kinds of _bitmaps and points.  Those which  are  inside  objects
; and those which are seperate objects themselves. If _userotate object  command
; is set to 32 or 64, then the entire object is considered to be either a point
; or _bitmap.  But if _userotate is not set this way, then  a  normal  object  is
; drawn and _bitmaps then come from within the object definitions (below).  this
; way, _bitmaps and points can be either part of a larger object,  or  they  are
; computed fast on their own. (eg explosions and bullets as  seperate  objects)

;
; Note: when writing surface descriptions, try to make the  first value unique
; from any other first value.  This way, the sort routine  will  give  a  more
; accurate sorting of sides. eg 1,3,6,1  2,4,1,2  rather than 1,3,6,1  1,2,4,1
; If this doesnt give you what you want, then try making the first two  points
; the farthest points from the objects centroid.

;
; To recap:
;
;        0 = constant colour, only visible from counter-clockwise side
;    wavey = sine texture
;    shade = shading - requires 3 blank words for surface normal eg dw 0,0,0
;  inverse = invert the shading direction, 0=normal, 1=sun is other way.
;     last = use intensity from previous surface (not colour, only intensity)
;     mesh = see through mesh - solid colour
;    glenz = cross referancing vector - load from screen, xrefs it, put back
;    stone = stone texture.  use stone.bas to make more textures.
;
;    point = point
;     line = line
;    himap = _bitmap (scalable, non-rotatable)
;    lomap = _bitmap (scalable, non-rotatable)
;  iterate = generate iteration if side visible
;     both = always visible
;   double = always visible but other side has high byte colour,"double sided"
;    onscr = plot side only if all the following points are on the screen
;    check = dont plot side but use the following points as a test for visiblity
;
; What you can't mix on a single surface: "double" with "both"!!

;
; You do not have to define a point for the center of the  object.  the  point
; 0 defines the center of the object.  This is different from earlier versions
; This point will ALWAYS be calculated and will always be the zero'th point.
;
; Iterations may or may not have an extra centroid point calculated  for  you.
; Whether or not a new point is added to  the  points  list  is  dependant  on
; whether or not a new centroid must be calculated.  Hmmm, how  can  I explain
; this...Ok, centroids are calculated with new matricies or centroid  offsets,
; they are also calculated if the centroid flag is set (4'th word).  So,  what
; does this mean to the lowly reader (you).  Some examples of iterations where
; new points are added to points list.
;
; Eg:
;  an iteration where new centroid IS NOT calculated and IS NOT inserted
;
;   dw iteration,0,0,colour,0 ,1,2,3,4,1
;       dw 1,1
;       dw 25 dup (0)
;          x y z
;       dw 5,5,5                 ; point 20 (for example)
;       dw 0,0,0,colour, 20,5,20 ; notice how this surface uses newly created point
;
;  an iteration where new centroid IS calculated and IS inserted
;
;   dw iteration+matrix,0,0,colour,0 ,1,2,3,4,1
;       dw 1,1
;       dw 25 dup (0)
;          x y z
;       dw 5,5,5                 ; point is now 21 (because matrix calculated new centroid)
;       dw 0,0,0,colour, 21,5,21 ; same surface as above.
;
; The "sub_object" command also forces a centroid to be calculated, and will
; also insert a new point into the points list.  Be aware of it's presance!
;
; Note: The centroid is always calculated as the zero'th point. The above rules
; only apply to whether or not a new centroid will appear  as  an  EXTRA  point
; in an ITERATION.
;
; Questions to ask yourself in trying to figure out the above text:
;   Have I made an iteration that has any centroidal offset?
;   Have I used the matrix command?
;   Hahe I used the sub_object command?
;   Have I set bit 0 of the 4'th word in the 25 dup's to 1?
;   Am I sexually frustrated?
; If you answer yes to any of these questions, then a new centroidal point will
; be calculated and inserted into the points list even if you dont ask for it!
;
; If you want to negate the effects of centroid  point  insertion,  simply  set
; the 7'th word (14'th byte) in those 25 dup's to 1. See below for more info.

;
; Here is a simple rundown of what those 25 extra words do:
;
;  dw x,y ; x=number of points,y=number of surfaces (but you knew that right?)
;
;  dw ? ; reserved for memory offset if an iteration is skipped   (leave blank)
;  dw ? ; reserved for point offset if an iteration is skipped    (leave blank)
;  dw ? ; reserved,is there a new center of gravity to calculate? (leave blank)
;       ; you could force this value to 1 (centroid in equ.inc) if you  wanted
;       ; to have a new centroid calculated with the iteration.
;  dw x,y,z ; new center-of-gravity point.  lets say you want a  subsurface  to
;           ; be offset by a certin spacial location, you can set these 3 words
;           ; to be "added" to any points you  are  adding  to  the  sub-object
;           ; listen bub, just mess around with it and you'll get  the  idea...
;  dw #     ; new load object offset for matrix compounding - this is only used
;           ; if the sub-object has a new matrix. (for rotation). commands like
;           ; matrix and sub_object access this word to determine where  in the
;           ; object lists (xs,ys,zs,_xadds,_zadds...) to get the  location and
;           ; rotation information about  the  sub-object.  check out the block
;           ; with the two smaller rotating  blocks  and  then look in main.asm
;           ; to figure out how to use this.  usual  values are 1 or 2, maybe 3
;           ; up to the number of extra sub_objects you've got.
;  dw #     ; connection data addition value.  this value  gets  added  to  the
;           ; connection data. eg: lets say you've got an object that starts at
;           ; point 3 and goes to 12, but you want to make it into a sub_object
;           ; (part of something larger) and you  want to change the connection
;           ; data to have a range of 25 to  36.  just put the value 22 in here
;           ; and all connection  data  within the object (and all sub_objects,
;           ; even in  sub_objects  within  sub_objects)  will  have this value
;           ; added to it.  this is usefull for, lets say,  making  a formation
;           ; of airplanes one big object instead  of  drawing  each individual
;           ; airplane. (if by some freak accident you wanted to do that)
;  dd #     ; maximum distance object can be seen (maxz)
;  dd #     ; minimum distance object can be seen (minz) - this can be negative
;           ; if you want.  but if it is  negative,  the  entire   object  must
;           ; be made up of sub-objects.  If these are left at zero, they  will
;           ; be forced to good values (_pre_cal_lambert does this).
;  dd #     ; screen tolerancing.  this is used to determine how  far  off  the
;           ; screen an object will remain visable.  past this, the object will
;           ; not be drawn.  try 1, then try 500. you'll  get  the  idea.  (get
;           ; close to the object.) if this is left  blank,  a  value  will  be
;           ; placed in for you.

; _pre_cal_lambert calculates the code offsets in case side is not visible,  but

; This demonstrates only one level of iteration, you can have as  many
; levels as you want.  Notice how sub iterations are written just like
; main objects.

; Concave surfaces work well when put inside iterations (saves cpu time), but
; convex surfaces don't work well. eg, insides  of  volcanos  are  great  for
; cutting cpu time, but exterior things like rooftop buildings must  be  done
; seperatly (Hint - Inlay the rooftop building below the edge of the roof and
; you can now have the building and all the stuff on the roof in a iteration)
