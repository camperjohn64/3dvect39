    Documentation is in  no  defined  order. Sorry, I just  sorta  lumped  my
    ideas together and ended up with this file.

    Routines support any  x mode, - but  page  flipping  is  not  allowed  in
    resolutions which allow only 1 page - see "pages" constant.

    Full clipping is  performed  to  user  defined  areas - see  constants  in
    equ.inc. They have   been   changed  to  memory  locations  for  variable
    windowing or multiple screens.  For  windowing,  the last z locations for
    that window must be remembered along with a slew of other  locations, see
    vars.inc for that  info.  To change a window, save the lastz information,
    reset with old lastz information and  then  call  set_clip  to change the
    border clipping and screen center data.

    The theoretical screen  is  considered  to be (x,y) with  0,0  being  the
    center of the  screen!.   So  -100,-100  is  somewhere  on  the top left!
    actual screen goes from (0,0) to (320,200)  -  or  whatever mode size you
    select.  Matt Pritchard's routines (xmode.asm) assume  0,0  to be the top
    left of the  screen  while  my routines (me = John = 3d.asm) consider the
    screen center to be the constants xcenter and ycenter.

    Visible space is  -4628196  to +4628196  on  all  axis  (approx).  Object
    locations are 32 bit, vector routines are 16 bit, objects must be smaller
    than 16 bit but are visable within about a 32 bit range.   (4 million, as
    it is now,  is  very  very  far).   Since the camera is always at (0,0,0)
    (relative), objects with (relative) negative z values are not seen.  This
    cuts the z space to 0 to 4mil.  Visible space is always divided by 256 so
    decimals can be allowed in adding, and  moving of objects.  Visible space
    therefore, is actually  from -1.024 billion to +1.024  billion  with  the
    lower byte having  no effect on the location.  Non-visible space is where
    objects can be but won't appear on screen.   This space is a 256 *256*256
    cube.  To racap:  you have 32 bit x,y,z axis with a visual  range  of  28
    bits, where the  lower  8  bits don't affect the location.  (Lower 8 bits
    don't count because locations are shr'ed)   i  say that the visable space
    is "about" 4mil only because of the code in the make3d routine: this code
    multiplies by a  constant  and then performs divide by  z  distance.   We
    cannot allow the  multiply  to  overflow  and  therefore must truncate our
    maximum distance to prevent this.  The  constants  for multiplication are
    the screen ratio constants and the calculation to test for an overflow is
    as such -2^32/2/256/(largest constant).  The constant I  have used is 464
    for the y  ratio.   I  have  used  this  because  of my desire to use the
    320x400 mode resolution.  Therefore, 4.3gig/2/256/464  = about 4 million -
    our maximum visual  distance.  Like, trust me, you don't  really  need  a
    larger universe.  Fixing  the  make  3d  routine  wont  allow  you to see
    farther because then you would have to fix the rotate routine, etc, etc.

     When defining a location: ebx = x, ecx = y, ebp = z
     When defining a rotation: x = pitch, y = heading, z = yaw
     si refers to object number, di refers to time.

     Rotations occure in order:
     zobject,xobject,yobject,ycamera,xcamera,zcamera - rotations are
     compounded in matrix for faster computation.

     Vmatrix is the matrix for object rotation.  Ematrix is  the  matrix  for
     camera rotation.   If  you want know where a point in space will show up
     on the screen, load ebx, ecx, ebp with your x,y,z point, subtract camera
     location and  call erotate (eye rotate).   The  point  will  be  rotated
     according to current camera angles.  Make sure that a call to setsincose
     has taken place to set the eye rotation matrix (ematrix).

     Polygon can handle any number of sides.  To draw a triangle,  make  last
     point equal  to first point, eg 1,4,5,1. Number of sides of a polygon is
     determined so that the polygon is  not  finished  until  the  last  side
     equals the first side:  eg 1,7,6,14,13,4,2,1 would be a 7 sided polygon.
     The constant maxsurfaces determines the  maximum number  of  surfaces an
     object can have.  The constant maxpolys determines the maximum number of
     connections a surface can have.

     Sample shape data:

     headerthing dd -1   ; distance that first resolution is visable, -1 = last
                 dd offset thing - offset $ - 4

     thing  dw 6        ; number of points
            dw 4        ; number of surfaces
            dw 25 dup (?) ; future use

            dw x,y,z    ; point 0
            dw x,y,z    ; point 1
            dw x,y,z
            ...

            dw command
            dw texture for side 1
            dw texture for side 2
            dw colour for side 1
            dw colour for side 2
            dw connection data eg (1,2,3,4,1)
            dw [?,?,?] [optional surface normal if shade command used]
            dw more connection data...
            ...

    There are several  commands  one can use for each surface.  Commands like
    steel texture, always visible, opposite  colours,  etc.  View the objects
    include file to see what/how to use them.

    Bitmaps can be part of an object or be made as separate  objects.  I will
    be using the  bitmaps  for  things  like  explosions, smoke (from damaged
    planes/spaceships) and distant suns/solar system (U know, like in x-wing)
    set the values bitx and bity to the  scaling  to  be used for each bitmap
    and set userotate to himap as this  is the command to define  a  bitmaped
    object.  vxs and  vys  are  the  additional  scaling  used for individual
    objects (vxs+bitx = final scaling factor).  When part  of an object,  use
    dw himap/lomap, point #, x scale, y scale.  Remember, scaling is added to
    bitx and bity so objects have a base scale plus some individual scale.

    Complex objects don't cut it for speed!  keep your objects simple and you
    can have more of them on screen at once!  maximum speed is found with low
    resolutions.  High resolutions with clipped borders also provide adequate
    speed.  A shallow but wide screen (small y, big x) provides  better usage
    of cpu time  than  a  tall  and thin screen.  One big object is faster to
    compute than many small objects (if  same  surface area) an object viewed
    from the  side  takes significantly less time to compute  than  if  viewed
    from the top  due  to  the shallow y, large x idea.   Object  shapes have
    abcd prefixes.  Therefore,  as  object  gets  farther from  camera,  less
    points/surface must be calculated.  You  must  define  shapes  for  every
    distance.   You can have only one distance/shape if you want or  you  can
    have hundreds.

       eg dd distance1
          dd offset thing1 - offset $ - 4
          dd distance2
          dd offset thing2 - offset $ - 4
          dd -1                            ; <- -1 is last distance flag
          dd offset thing3 - offset $ - 4

    Surface data must be entered counter clockwise so side  will be  visible.
    Clockwize surfaces are  visible  from  other side and will not be plotted
    (unless you use a surface command override, see objects.inc)

    An increase in screen objects increases  cpu time.  However, if you  know
    that you will always have the screen filled (in the case  of  floors, and
    runways.) You can  disable  the clear_fill routine during those parts! if
    the screen will be covered with background  walls  and  such, there is no
    purpose to call  the  clear  routine to compute the next  part!   i  have
    therefore added a  flag  for  the  clear_fill  routine  to use: when your
    animation comes to the part when your looking at the ground or walls (and
    there are NO empty spaces) toggle the  flag  to  skip  clear_fill and get
    more  cpu  time.   This also works if you are approaching  an  object  or
    large surface, since  the  new object will totally cover the previous one.
    Another time trick is to have your main background object include the sky
    (or area to be cleared) as part of the  object.  If you are going to have
    walls that go  halfway  up  the  screen,  have them go halfway  with  the
    regular walls and then make another surface that goes to the top  of  the
    screen (or above  if you want to move around) with the colour 0.  You can
    then deactivate the  clear_fill routine  and  still  have  the  animation
    appear as if the walls are completely separate objects.

    Sorting routine for objects (as opposed to sides) uses  last  z  value to
    re-sort for the  next  plot.   If you plan on drawing static pictures you
    may want to call makobjs twice to: 1)  draw  and find zeds, sort, then 2)
    re-draw. This will be the only way (and easiest way) to  plot an accurate
    picture of what   we   have.  Don't  worry  about  calling  twice  during
    animations as the first picture will  be  the  only  picture  that is not
    sorted.  During animations,  all  objects are sorted properly,  based  on
    previous z.

    Routines which are  expected to be used in animations have been optimized
    but routines intended for use as background  and  title draw routines are
    not intended to be fast.

     PLEASE DOCUMENT YOUR CHANGES!!

    Newfollow routine does  not  handle  object  lock on well  if  object  is
    accelerating.  The routine  calculates  where  the  object  will be in di
    frames and attempts to point the camera  to it in di frames.  However, if
    the object is  accelerating, then the object will not  be  where  it  was
    expected to be  at  that  time.   So  the  camera  must re-lock on to its
    target.  This loop commences until the  camera  actually has locked on to
    the target object, from this point on, the camera will  follow the object
    regardless of motion.   The  re-lock on sequence takes the last number of
    frames and divides it by two, so the re-lock on loop will move toward  an
    accelerating object at an accelerating rate.

    General overview: locations are 32  bit  -2.1Gig  to  +2.1Gig, angles are
    16bit from 0-65535 degrees, 4 quadrants - 4096 entries each quadrant.

    Variables in vector routine are 16bit.  cosine and sine  list  are  words
    but get converted into doublewords when used.

    There are more routines at the end of  3d.asm  for more general functions
    like find the camera displacement and finding rotational  offsets between
    two objects.  U figure them out - fairly self explanatory. Also check out
    poly.inc for more 3d functions and math.inc for general math functions.

    Drawvect  routine has a separate routine for drawing lines (as opposed to
    surfaces).  The fake_line  routine and poly_fill routine could do the job
    but they were too slow.  The line was drawn twice then filled just like a
    polygon but now a separate routine clips  and  draws.  If you  need/want
    to use this line  drawing  routine  it  has   been   separated  from  the
    draw_vect  routine.  I  do  not use the xmode line draw by Matt Pritchard
    as it does not allow for clipping.

    Sin and cosin tables - 90 degrees is 16384, 180=32768...

    Move_si routine - to move an object around, load up ebx, ecx and ebp with
    the x,y,z locations of where you want the object to end up.  Load di with
    the time you would like the object to take to get there. Load si with the
    object number you want to move and call  move_si.  The updvectors routine
    does the rest!

    To look at an object.  either 1) put the object number  in  wherelook. or
    2) load si  with the object to look at, load di with the time to move the
    camera to the object, and call new_follow.

    Just think, only  7 months ago (march '93), i had trouble  programming  a
    batch file!

  Shape data can be almost as large as you need it 'till it crashes. try a cube
  20000x20000x20000.    Calculations  use  32  bit  registers  and  can  handle
  up to 16 bit locations.  keeping the object size small will  allow  a  larger
  visible space.  but larger objects will allow you to  get  closer  with  more
  accuracy in the mathematics of rotations.

  List of command bits to date: (for object definitions)

  note: "visible" = "points appear counter-clockwise"

  texture definitions:

    0       - normal surface, no features, constant colour.
    wavey   - steel texture for surface 0 = none,  colour  offset  determines
              screen offset for texture.  eg 16+7 will use colour block 16-31
              but make the sine wave texture 14 (7*2) lines down. this is  so
              all sine wave textures do not appear on the same line.
              windows and engines look good with this feature.
    shade   - lambert shading bit, must have normal calculated or  at  least
              have    free    space     for    pre_cal_lambert    to    use:
              eg 128,16*1,1,2,3,1, ?,?,?<- these 3 words are surface normal!
    inverse - inversion bit for shading option.  0=normal shading, 1=inverse
              if option +4  is used, inversion  automatically  occures  when
              other side is displayed.
    glow    - =shade+inverse
    last    - colour has same colour as previous surface (used when
              you want gourad shading, but want to avoid  duplicate
              calculations - don't set gourad bit if this  is  what
              you use it for.) when this is used, the colour number
              determines the new colour block to use.  the  shading
              of this colour will be the same as the surface before
              it, but the colour block can be different.
    mesh    - screen door style of surface
    stone   - texture map style surface, I just liked the way it looked..
    glenz   - glenz vector surface - uses cross referancing palette for
              changing on screen colours.

  commands:

    point   - defines a single point; must be repeated! eg dw 64,col,3,3
    line    - if used, defines a line (must be set to define a true line)
    himap   - if set, defines a bitmap,eg: point #, bitmap #, x scale,y scale
    lomap   - uses 1/4 scaled bitmap (every 4'th pixel is sampled), fast

    iterate - generate iteration if side visible (iteration = sub-object)

    both    - side is always visible no matter angle, skips counter-clowise test
            - "both sides have same texture"
    double  - side is always visible but other side has high byte colour
              "double sided surface"
              note: if this is used, option "both" must not be used!!
    onscr   - test if side is on screen - don't use if all points are
              outside clipping parameters.
    check   - dont plot this side, just use as test points for visibility.
              this is mostly used with iterations.
    matrix  - generate new matrix
    sub-object - make subobject
    gosub      - transfer loading of surface data elsewhere
    return     - return from gosub


  There are a kazillion more options - look in the  objects.inc  file  for  the
  surface types and example objects.

  There are two kinds of bitmaps and points.  Those which  are  inside  objects
  and those which are separate objects themselves. if userotate object  command
  is set to himap/point,then  the  entire  object  is  considered  as  a  point
  or bitmap.  But if userotate is not set this way, then  a  normal  object  is
  drawn and bitmaps then come from within the object definitions (below).  this
  way, bitmaps and points can be either part of a larger object,  or  they  are
  computed fast on their own. (eg explosions and bullets as  separate  objects)

  Note: When writing surface descriptions, try to make the  first value unique
  from any other first value.  this way, the sort routine  will  give  a  more
  accurate sorting of sides. eg 1,3,6,1  2,4,1,2  rather than 1,3,6,1  1,2,4,1

  to recap:

         0 = constant colour, only visible from counter-clockwise side
     wavey = sine texture
     shade = shading - requires 3 blank words for surface normal eg dw 0,0,0
   inverse = invert the shading direction, 0=normal, 1=sun is other way.
      last = use intensity from previous surface (not colour, only intensity)
     point = point
      line = line
     himap = bitmap (scalable, non-rotatable)
     lomap = bitmap (scalable, non-rotatable)
   iterate = generate iteration if side visible
      both = always visible
    double = always visible but other side has high byte colour,"double sided"
     onscr = plot side only if all the following points are on the screen
     check = dont plot side but use the following points as a test for visiblity

  What you can't mix on a single surface: "double" with "both"!!

  You do not have to define a point for the center of the  object.  the  point
  0 defines the center of the object.  This is different from earlier versions

  Remember that negative y (-y) is up, +y is down.  This is opposite  from our
  regular grade 13 mathematics but it is consistant with the computers  screen
  arrangement.  If your objects look funny, make sure you have this correct.

  The shading for objects requires that 3  words be  present  after  the  side
  definition.  These 3 words represent the surface normal to the side and  can
  be either set by you (slow and tedious) by using the normal.bas program,  or
  can be set up by the routine pre_cal_lambert.  This routine scans the object
  to find surfaces that have the shading bit set (128).   The  surface  normal
  will be calculated for that surface and stored in the 3 words set  aside  by
  you.  If you remove the shading feature from a surface, make sure you remove
  the extra 3 words or it will screw up.  But you knew that right.  To use the
  routine pre_cal_lambert, load si with the object you wish to scan, and call.
  make sure objbase points to the offset of the object.  si will be the object
  number, eg 0,1,2,3, not the offset. The offset will come from objbase.

  Each on-screen object can have it's own colour palette scheme by setting the
  palxref offsets to a cross reference palette.  this uses the xlat command to
  take the objects colour, and xlat it into a new colour  based  on  the  xref
  table you provide.  each object can have it own xref table.  This way,  many
  on-screen objects can use the same shape data while each is coloured  with a
  different colour scheme (5 stuka  airplanes  all  coloured  differently, for
  example)  You will find the palxref tables (for each object remember) in the
  file equ.inc.  A routine set_xref_palette has been provided for you  so  you
  can set the xref offset (this routine is in poly.inc)

  To have a bitmap on the screen (scalable but non-rotatable) use option himap
  in either userotate or as an object command.  Lomap  uses  the  same  bitmap
  method but only draws every 4'th pixel - good for explosions and smoke.

  onoff commands:

  0 = object off          eg mov onoff[esi],2  ; turn on sub object
  1 = main object on
  2 = sub object on

  userotate object commands:

  0  = all rotations supported - full object

  1  = camera rotations only - no compound, new loadpoints

      object is same as when userotate=0 but will not allow any object specific
      rotations.  this is used to speed up rendering of objects that are
      stationary or objects that will always be pointing in the same direction.
      make1obj routine then assumes angles = 0x, 0y, 0z

      if this is used to define a sub-object (see main.asm for that green box
      with those two sub-object blocks) then +1 option in userotate makes the
      box angle/rotation independant from the main object.

  himap = bitmap - no compound, no loadpoints, no sort and no drawvect
  lomap = bitmap, 1/4 scale, faster than 32

      if object is bitmap, then:

      whatshape - indexer to which bitmap in bitbase list
      xs,ys,zs  - point to bitmap location in space
      vxs       - bitmap scaling (how big is bitmap).  note: bitmap is already
                  scaled based on distance so you don't have to change this
                  as the bitmap gets farther away.

  point = point - no compound, no loadpoints, no sort and no drawvect

      used for bullets.  could be used for stars but if you do  want  to  make
      stars, make a specialized bitmap routine.  making stars as objects would
      be too slow.  right now, bullets all have same colour, see  constant  in
      equ.inc.  note:sept 29/93, stars routines now are a seperate specialized
                     assembley routine. - stars.asm

      xs,ys,zs  - point to bullet location in space

  The locations of sub_objects are x/256 because of the way conversion between
  real space co-ordinates and object co-ordinates  are   calculated.   Objects
  are 256 times larger than their appearance in real space. This  allows  much
  greater  accuracy  in  real  space!!    Eg ,  if  you have a  cube  500x500x
  500 (which is really 1000 wide cause -500 to +500 is 1000  units)  then,  in
  order to "move" accros the surface, you should only have to move 1000 units,
  right?  Well here, you'll have to move 256000 units even though the cube  is
  only 1000 units wide/tall/deep.  This is because the real space co-ordinates
  are 24 bit (32bit/256).  This gives you greater accuracy in placing  objects
  where you want them in space but still allows you to have very large objects

  If your objects appear jittery when viewing close-up, make  them  physically
  larger.  For example, double all the point  data  (makes  object  twice  the
  size).  This way, the multiply routine has more  accuracy  when  calculating
  rotations/3dpoints.

  Example of how to draw a single polygon:

           p1x equ -50
           p1y equ -50
           p2x equ -90
           p2y equ 70
           p3x equ 60
           p3y equ 80

           mov x1,p1x
           mov y1,p1y
           mov x2,p2x
           mov y2,p2y
           call fakeline  ; draw in buffer

           mov x1,p2x
           mov y1,p2y
           mov x2,p3x
           mov y2,p3y
           call fakeline  ; draw in buffer

           mov x1,p3x
           mov y1,p3y
           mov x2,p1x
           mov y2,p1y
           call fakeline  ; draw in buffer

           mov colq,7
           mov steel,-1
           call poly_fill ; fill polygon on screen

           call flip_page ; show it...


  A little note about polygon construction:

   Polygons can only have angles less than 180 degrees. That is, they must be
   round like circles, not hooky like a sickle.  eg:

                         /\
   /\                    \ \ invalid polygon
   \ \ valid polygon     /  \
    \ \                  \/\ \
     \/                     \/
                           ^
                           |---------this angle is greater than 180degrees.

  if you want to make this here^^^^, you must split it up into 2:
                      /\               /\
                      \ \              \ \
          /\     +     \ \      =      /  \
          \/            \ \            \/\ \
                         \/               \/

   So, an object like so:    ____
                            / __ \
                           /_/  \_\

   must be drawn like so:
                ____       ____
     /\ + /\  + \__/   =  / __ \
    /_/   \_\            /_/  \_\


  Question:  How come my objects appear upside-down
  Answer: Thats because the Y axis is inverted.  Positive X points to the
          right, positive Z points away from you and positive Y points down.

  Question: Ok, I make the Y value point down, now they still don't look
            right - the surfaces are connected correctly but it looks wrong.
  Answer: The most probable reason for this type of error is that the
          connection data has been entered in reverse order.  Eg 3,4,5,2,7,3
          should probably have been entered as 3,7,2,5,4,3. Remember, enter
          the surfaces in Counter-Clock-Wise order.

  If you don't like manual data entry (which I don't)  you  can  try  out the
  converter DXF23DV which should be supplied with this package. Now just draw
  your objects in AutoCAD and it will convert them into assembly connections
  Remember, in AutoCAD +z points up, +y point away, in my package, +z  points
  away, +y points down.  Draw the objects in Autocad as if +z is  up  and  my
  converter will change the co-ordinate system for you.

  Question: The objects look great from far away, but up  close,  the  appear
            "jumpy" or the whole thing disappears.
  Answer: Your using too small a scale factor.  If you have a cube  10x10x10,
          the math routines don’t have much room to calculate a rotated object
          Try making your objects bigger, like  1000x1000x1000.   The  reason
          why the entire object may disappear is  that  the   center  of  the
          object has passed to close  to  the  camera.   If  you  have  large
          objects, you may want to cut them up  into  separate  sections  and
          piece them together as a separate objects.
